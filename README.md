# localization-problem
There is a known problem: finding the best location for water monitoring station, w.s.t. 6 objectives (like power lines, roads, rivers, ...). 
I hired a HyPE multi-objective indicator inside a genethic algorithm to find a proper location.
I know answers are not optimal.

main paper for hype indicator:
Bader, Johannes, and Eckart Zitzler. "HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization." Evolutionary computation 19.1 (2011): 45-76.


Project is a Console C# app,
input data are inside bin Folder,
also config file is there. i dont like to write more.
